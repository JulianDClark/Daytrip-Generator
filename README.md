# Daytrip-Generator 
In this project i created a day trip generator recieving random elements and declaring variables for a random destination, restaurant, transportation, and entertainment categories and coded them into ways python could randomly select one of these choices to help the "user" on their trip. It was also coded to prompt the "user" to see if they were satisfied wwith the quality of the trip and if not which feature they would want to change and randomly select a new one.
